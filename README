# Compressed-sensing diffusion spectrum imaging (CS-DSI)

This dataset contains diffusion, anatomical, functional, and field mapping neuroimaging data
from a diffusion protocol comparison study used in
[Radhakrishnan et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.26580).

## Diffusion spectrum imaging data

acq-HASC92: This corresponds to the HA-SC92 CS-DSI scheme from the paper.
There are 92 unique directions.

acq-HASC55 run-01: This corresponds to the HA-SC55–1 CS-DSI scheme from the paper.
There are 55 unique directions.

acq-HASC55 run-02: This corresponds to the HA-SC55–2 CS-DSI scheme from the paper.
There are 55 unique directions.

acq-RAND57: This corresponds to the RAND57 CS-DSI scheme from the paper.
There are 57 unique directions.

The HA-SC92+55–1 and HA-SC92+55–2 CS-DSI schemes can be reconstructed by
preprocessing the HA-SC92 and HA-SC55 files and then concatenating them
before doing any reconstruction.
HA-SC92+55–1 uses HA-SC92 and HA-SC55-1, while HA-SC92+55–2 uses HA-SC92 and HA-SC55-2.
